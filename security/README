Assignment 5 README

There were 3 security flaws identified in Jacob Apkon's web application; each had an analysis and suggested resolution. The format of the report was followed.

I referred to Gabe Jacobs' Security Assessment example, and Ming Chow's Javascript Pitfalls presentation.

I spent about 4 hours on the assignment.
