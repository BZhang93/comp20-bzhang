5. GameManager.prototype.actuate() stores the scores and grid in this.score and this.grid.
6. A $.post() is used to send the variable data, which includes the objects score = this.score, grid = JSON.stringify(this.grid), time = new Date(), created_at = time.toUTCString(), and data = "username=bryan&score="+ score + "&grid=" + grid + "&created_at=" + created_at.
