Comp20: Assignment 2 Readme

The images (sky, road, bushes, tree, dogs, and birds) were all implemented, although I added an extra dog and 4 extra birds.
I did not implement a dirt road with the color code #C96A1B; I just directly spliced the dirt road from the sprite.

I discussed and collaborated the assignment with Dong Park.
I spent about 3 hours on the assignment.
